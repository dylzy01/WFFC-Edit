- Can flatten x,y,z positions
- Can paint texture
- Can save paint

OBJECT
- Can spawn grass, trees, water
- Spawning snaps to nearest terrain if within distance bounds,
	if not then just spawns at 100.f along ray trace
- Can edit transforms
	- Can translate freely or along constrained x,y,z
	- Can rotate freely or along constrained x,y,z
	- Can scale freely or along constrained x,y,z
		- Scale has minimum scale value of 0.1f to avoid the object scaling
			inside itself

SAVE
- Can save objects
